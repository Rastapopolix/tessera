# Tessera 2.0 manual

Tessera is a generative firmware for the M-Vave FM-1. It grew out of Melodee (Tess), a fork of
[Melodee](https://github.com/keremimo/melodee) by keremimo (itself built on *Felucca* by Leo Kuroshita / Hügelton
Instruments). Each of the four tracks can play its own steps, an arpeggio, or one of thirteen generators, and the
pages around them evolve the phrases, build song forms, pass hits between tracks and modulate anything from
anything.

This manual covers what Tessera adds and changes. The step sequencer, the effects and the song pages work as in
upstream Melodee. For recipes and tips, see **[RECIPES.md](RECIPES.md)**; every button and combination on one
sheet, **[CHEATSHEET.md](CHEATSHEET.md)** (and [a printable PDF](docs/cheatsheet/tessera-cheatsheet.pdf)). Every
setting, with its range and default, is listed in [docs/PARAMETERS.md](docs/PARAMETERS.md).

Page and knob names are the ones on the screen. KNOB 1 to KNOB 4 are the four knobs from left to right, and each
page's four settings sit along the top of the screen in the same order.

## The panel at a glance

| Button | Tap | Hold |
|---|---|---|
| **HOME** | The home page: four tracks, their sounds and knobs | The menu |
| **SEQ** | GEN, then the pages of the track's MODE | PATTERNS (the song under it) |
| **ARP** | ARP's MODE and its page (again: ARP 2) | The help card for any knob you turn |
| **LFO** | MODS, MATRIX, LFO, LFO 2, ORGANIC, LFO DEST (an FM6 track: then FM LFO) | |
| **ENV** | ENV, ENV DEST (an FM6 track: EG RATE, EG LVL, PITCH EG, PITCH LV) | |
| **SCL** | SCALES, SCL, CHORD | Quick SET: a key sets ROOT; KNOB 1 to 4 set ROOT, SCL, CHRD, VOIC |
| **EDIT** | The sound's EDIT pages; on an EDIT page, the map | With OCT- / OCT+: undo / redo |
| **FX** | The insert and send effects | The mod amount of any knob you turn |
| **GLO** | MIXER, GLOBAL, SYSTEM, MIDI OUT | Quick SET: the black keys mute T1 to T4, the white keys solo while held, KNOB 1 to 4 the levels, F4 taps the tempo; with PLAY, restart from the top |
| **SAVE** | USER (ready to save the sound), PROJECT, PRESETS | Save the project to its slot (as SAVE + REC) |
| **REC** | Record | Capture or print the last bars (see [Print and keep](#print-and-keep)) |
| **OCT+** | Octave up; on some pages, an action (shown on screen) | A page's extra layer (see [OCT+ layers](#oct-layers-on-gen)) |

On the home page each track's tile shows its sound and engine. **ALGORITHM** picks the track on every page (or
the left knob, with MENU > TRACK KNOB set to LEFT), and **SELECT** turns the pages of the section shown. The four sounds a new project starts with are an ambient set: **GLASS PAD**,
**STRINGS** and **BELLS** on FM6, and the **808 KIT** on DRUM. A new project has no mods, so nothing moves until
you patch it.

<p align="center"><img src="assets/gallery/home.png" alt="HOME" width="320"> <img src="assets/gallery/mixer.png" alt="MIXER" width="320"></p>

**MIXER** (tap GLO) is the four tracks as a mixer: **KNOB 1 to 4** set the levels of tracks 1 to 4, and with
**OCT+** held they set the pans. The keys are the mixer's while it is shown: the **black keys** F#3 G#3 A#3 C#4 mute
and unmute tracks 1 to 4, the **white keys** F3 G3 A3 B3 solo a track while held, **C4** unmutes them all and **F4**
taps the tempo, the same as with GLO held on any other page. Each strip shows MUTE or SOLO; a track silenced by
another's solo dims. Any page button leaves the mixer, and the keys play notes again.

**Lists** (the HOME menu, SCL, VOICE, the sheets and the sound designer): KNOB 1 picks the row, KNOB 2 changes its
value.

**The look.** Tessera's palette is **SMALTI**, lapis and gold. MARMO, VITRO, NIGHT and CONTRAST are in MENU >
COLOR. Each track has its own colour, used for its tile, its cords and its row in MATRIX.

## Shortcuts

| Do this | And this happens |
|---|---|
| Tap **SEQ** | **GEN** first: KNOB 1 (**MODE**) picks what the track plays. SEQ then shows only that mode's pages. |
| Tap **ARP** | Switches a STEP track to ARP and opens **ARP**; tap again for **ARP 2**. On a generator track it opens GEN instead ("ARP: MODE ON GEN"), so a playing generator never goes quiet by accident. |
| Hold **OCT+** on GEN | The generator's second layer, for TURING, EUCLID, QUAD, CHORD, ATLAS, CONSTELLATION and ANSWER (see [OCT+ layers](#oct-layers-on-gen)). |
| **GEN** on an AWAKE track, a white key | Picks that step: KNOB 1 sets its A, KNOB 2 its B. The same key lets it go. |
| Hold **ARP**, turn a knob | The [help card](#help-card) for that knob. Turn the same knob further to scroll a long text. |
| Hold **FX**, turn a knob | Sets how far a cord moves that knob's parameter (see [Mod shortcut](#mod-shortcut)). |
| Hold **REC** | On a generator track: prints its last bars into STEP. On STEP EVOLVE: keeps the changes. On a STEP track: captures what you just played. |
| Hold **EDIT**, press **OCT-** / **OCT+** | Undo / redo. |
| **SAVE** + **REC**, or hold **SAVE** | Saves the project to its slot (stops playback first). |
| **EVOLVE**, KNOB 4 (**ROLL**) | Each click is a new seed (1 to 128), so a new line; turn back for the last one, note for note. |
| **FORM**, KNOB 3 (**CLEAR**) | Forgets B and C: the section playing becomes A. |
| **MODS**, **OCT+** | Switches the picked mod between BI and UNI. |
| **MATRIX**, **OCT+** | Opens the picked mod in MODS. |
| **EDIT** on an EDIT page | The map of the sound's pages: KNOB 1 across a row, KNOB 2 between rows, OCT+ opens the page, OCT- or EDIT closes it. Any other page button leaves it for its page. |
| **PLAY** | Every generator starts its random choices from the top of its seed, and TIDE and SWARM restart: with EVOLVE's EVERY off, a project plays the same way each time. |

---

## Sounds

Tessera 2.0 has three engines on the device:

| Engine | What it is |
|---|---|
| **FM6** | Six-operator FM in the manner of the DX7: 32 algorithms, operator envelopes and scaling, pitch EG, LFO and the function settings (bend, porta, wheel, foot, breath, aftertouch). Its ENGINE setting picks MODERN, MARK I (the DX7's own tables) or OPL. The main melodic voice. |
| **TRIO** | Three oscillators: WAVE, INT2, INT3 (intervals) and DETUNE. Basses and leads. |
| **DRUM** | Drum kits: **808**, **909** and **SID KIT** (every drum on a C64 chip). Eight lanes: BD, SD, CP, CH, OH, TM, RS, CB. The 808 has six tom pitches. |

<p align="center"><img src="assets/gallery/edit_fm6.png" alt="FM6 ALGO page" width="240"> <img src="assets/gallery/fm6_eg.png" alt="FM6 operator envelope" width="240"> <img src="assets/gallery/drum.png" alt="DRUM steps" width="240"></p>

**SID** and **PHYS** are no longer in the device build, and neither are CZ-1 and Prophet. A track saved with SID
loads FM6's INIT; one saved with PHYS loads FM6's first voice. DRUM's SID KIT stays. FM6 and TRIO presets have
releases that ring out, so short sequenced notes are not cut off. The slow pads (GLASS PAD, SOFT PAD, DEEP PAD, PAD,
STRINGS) swell in slowly: they speak on long notes and drones, and stay quiet on short steps.

**PRESETS** (SAVE) browses the sounds. Its LIST knob picks ALL, the favourites, RECENT or a category, and it starts
on ALL at power-on.

### How many voices at once

All the tracks share one pool of voices, set by **GLO > GLOBAL > BUDGET** (16 by default). A note that rings on in
its release still holds a voice, so a busy generator on a sound with a long release can keep most of the pool
ringing on its own: TINE EP under MARKOV at 100 % density and 1/16 holds about 15. When the pool is full, a new note
takes the oldest released voice; when the FM-1 has more six-operator voices to work out than it has time for, you
hear a faint crackle.

One busy FM6 track like that is fine; two or more of them at full density is past the FM-1's limit. To keep it
clean:

- thin one of them (DENSITY, DROP, or a slower DIV);
- give one a shorter note (LENGTH) or a sound with a shorter release, such as a TRIO voice or DRUM;
- lower **BUDGET** (12, say): fewer voices ring at once, which leaves the FM-1 headroom; higher allows more, and
  crackles sooner.

---

## SEQ: the MODE and its pages

Tap **SEQ** for **GEN**, where **KNOB 1, MODE** picks what the selected track plays:

- **STEP**: the step sequencer.
- **ARP**: the arpeggiator over the keys held (the ARP button gets here too).
- One of thirteen generators, in the knob's order: **CHORD** first, then **TURING**, **EUCLID**, **MARKOV**,
  **MORPH**, **ATLAS**, **BOUNCE**, **AWAKE**, **POLY**, **QUAD**, **CONSTL** (Constellation), **SERIES** and
  **ANSWER**.

SEQ then shows only that mode's pages:

| MODE | SEQ's pages |
|---|---|
| **STEP** | GEN, EVOLVE (STEP EVOLVE), TWEAK (its HUMAN), TIMING (its SHAPE and HUMAN), NOTES, PATTERN, TEMPO, PATTERNS, SONG |
| **ARP** | GEN, ARP, ARP 2, NOTES, PATTERN, TEMPO, PATTERNS, SONG |
| a generator | GEN, EVOLVE, FORM, TWEAK, TWEAK 2, LENGTH, TIMING, ENERGY, PATTERN, TEMPO, PATTERNS, SONG |

MOTION and DRUM HIT appear as in upstream. With STEP, GEN's KNOB 2 to 4 are DIVISION, SWING and GATE. The
generators run at the track's DIV (PATTERN page) and play in the track's scale (SCL). Choosing STEP or a
generator turns the arpeggiator off; choosing ARP again brings back its last setting.

<p align="center"><img src="assets/gallery/seq_mode.png" alt="GEN with MODE STEP" width="320"></p>

### The pattern's sheet: Double, Half, Euclid

Hold **OCT+** on NOTES, PATTERN or the drum grid for the pattern's sheet. Besides Quantize, Clear pattern and
Clear motion it has:

- **Double**: the pattern twice as long (up to 64 steps). Its steps, recorded notes and motion are copied after
  themselves; a playing pattern carries on into the copy.
- **Half**: LEN halved (15 steps become 8). The steps past it stay, hidden, as when LEN is turned down.
- **Euclid**: KNOB 2 sets the hits ("5 of 16 BD"), and OCT+ spreads them over LEN as evenly as they go, the first
  on step 1. On the drum grid it writes the selected lane. On NOTES it writes one note row: the note at the
  cursor, else the pattern's first note, else ROOT. A step with a hit gets the note, and a step without one loses
  it. Other lanes and notes stay as they are. **Euclid turn** (KNOB 2) starts the hits that many steps later.
  It does not work on a pattern with recorded notes.

Each one is undone with **EDIT** held, one at a time.

---

## The generators

Each generator's three settings are on GEN, KNOB 2 to 4, and the panel under them shows what it plays. Every
generator is also a mod source: its **GATE**, its **NOTE** and a **CV** (see [MODS](#mods-the-modulation-cords)).

| MODE | KNOB 2 | KNOB 3 | KNOB 4 | What it plays |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **TURING** | LENGTH (2–16) | PROB (0–100 %) | SPAN (1–3 oct) | A looping shift register, as a Turing Machine. PROB is the chance a step changes as it comes round: 0 locks the loop (the knob reads Lock), 100 is new every pass. |
| **EUCLID** | STEPS (1–32) | PULSE | ROT | Hits spread as evenly as they go over STEPS, turned round by ROT, on pitches picked by the seed. |
| **MARKOV** | LEAP (0–100 %) | DENS (5–100 %) | SPAN (1–3 oct) | A random walk over eight scale degrees. LEAP 0 moves to neighbours, 100 leaps widely. DENS is the chance a step plays. |
| **MORPH** | POS (0–127) | SNP A (1–8) | SNP B (1–8) | A rhythm blended from preset A into preset B. POS starts halfway. |
| **ATLAS** | X (0–255) | Y (0–255) | DENS (0–100 %) | Inspired by Émilie Gillet's Grids (Mutable Instruments): its drum map, kick, snare, closed hat and a fourth part from the point X, Y. Best on a DRUM track. More on the [OCT+ layer](#atlas-kick-snr-hat-toms). |
| **BOUNCE** | SPEED (1–64) | ANGLE (0–90°) | BALLS (1–4, Fall) | Balls in a box: a note where a ball hits a wall. Each extra ball starts from its own place and angle; balls that hit on the same step play together, three notes at most. Past 4, **FALL** (after ambalek's norns script Fall): eight leaves fall at their own speeds and play where they land (left low, right high), and ANGLE becomes **WIND**: calm in the middle, leaning the melody low or high either side, gusting further out. |
| **AWAKE** | LEN A (1–16) | LEN B (1–16) | PROB (0–100 %) | Two loops, as norns' Awake. A is the melody (scale degrees or rests), B lifts it up the scale; different lengths shift B against A. Steps can be set from the keys (below). |
| **POLY** | RHY (1–4) | DIVISION (OFF, /1–/16) | SPAN (1–3 oct) | Four notes stepped on by four rhythms. RHY picks which rhythm DIVISION edits. Rhythms that land together play once, louder: /4 against /3 is a polyrhythm. |
| **QUAD** | DIR | PROB (0–100 %) | LINK | A 4 x 4 grid of notes the four tracks share, a row each, inspired by the norns script initenere. Each QUAD track plays its row on its own DIV, so the polyrhythm comes from the tracks' speeds. DIR: FWD, BACK, PEND, RAND or HOLD. LINK: the other QUAD tracks this one's steps also move on (HOLD tracks then play only when pulled). More on the [OCT+ layer](#quad-columns-and-range). |
| **CONSTL** | Y (0–14) | DENS (0–100 %) | SPEED | After timothy-taylor's norns script Constellation: a ship flies through a sky of stars; the stars that cross its crosshair play. Y is the crosshair's height (where the melody sits), DENS how many stars, SPEED how fast the sky passes (the straight note values, slow to fast). More on the [OCT+ layer](#constellation-lock-len-fill-size). |
| **SERIES** | START (0–127) | INTV (1–7) | LOOP (OFF, 1–16) | Per Nørgård's infinity series (after the norns script nørgård): a melody alike at every scale. START picks where it begins, INTV how many scale degrees a step of the series is, LOOP repeats that many steps (OFF never repeats). |
| **CHORD** | PROG | BARS (½, 1, 2, 4) | HIT | A progression's chords in the track's scale: POP (I V vi IV), 50S, 2-5-1, CIRCLE, TWO, DRONE, WALK (four chords from the seed) or USER (your own). HIT: HOLD (once, held), BEAT, STEP or OFFBEAT (short stabs on the "and" between the beats, a reggae skank). See [Harmony](#harmony-one-key-chord-and-qnt-chrd). |
| **ANSWER** | VARY (0–100 %) | ECHO (0–100 %) | FADE (1–16, LOOPS) | After Zen-1's call and response (the idea only): play a phrase on the track's keys (or MIDI IN), up to 8 notes, and a bar without a key ends it. ANSWER plays it back, after a rest, as answers that change a little more each time (VARY: a note moved a degree or two, an octave, left out or swapped), each softer than the last. ECHO repeats some notes once more at half the velocity. FADE is how many answers it gives, 1 to 16, before it rests until you play again; turned all the way up (LOOPS) it never forgets and plays on as four loops of different lengths. Its OCT+ layer: ORDER (PLAYED, REVERSE, SHUFFLE), SHIFT (each answer moved up to this many scale degrees), SPACE (the rest before an answer, up to 4 bars) and LEN (the loops' lengths at FADE LOOPS). |

**AWAKE step entry.** On GEN with an AWAKE track the keys are its steps and play no sound. A white key picks a
step: KNOB 1 sets its A value, KNOB 2 its B. Press the same key again, or leave the page, to go back to the usual
knobs.

**Seeds.** Every generator's random choices come from the track's seed (EVOLVE's ROLL). A seed sets the starting
material too: Turing's register, Euclid's pitches, Markov's first state, Awake's loops, Poly's notes, Quad's cells,
the sky. A track gets a random seed the first time a generator is picked, so each power-on starts somewhere new; a
saved project keeps its seeds.

---

## OCT+ layers on GEN

Some generators have more settings than three knobs. Hold **OCT+** on GEN: the knobs' labels move onto tiles in the
track's colour, an OCT+ key shows in the header, and the four knobs set the layer. Let go to return.

<p align="center"><img src="assets/gallery/gen_grids_oct.png" alt="ATLAS with OCT+ held" width="240"> <img src="assets/gallery/gen_chord_oct.png" alt="CHORD with OCT+ held" width="240"> <img src="assets/gallery/gen_chord_user.png" alt="CHORD USER with OCT+ held" width="240"></p>

### ATLAS: KICK, SNR, HAT, TOMS

| Knob | Setting | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **KICK** (0–100 %) | How much of DENS the kick gets: 0 silences it. |
| 2 | **SNR** | The same for the snare. |
| 3 | **HAT** | The same for the closed hat. |
| 4 | **TOMS** (0–100 %; labelled with the part's sound, TOM at first) | A fourth part: the hits the kick and snare only just miss, so fills follow the groove. 0 (OFF) none. |

With OCT+ held, a **black key** picks the fourth part's sound, as on the drum grid: TOM, CLAP, OPEN HAT, RIM or
BELL. The parts are also mod destinations: AT KICK, AT SNR, AT HAT, AT TOMS.

### CHORD: OCT, CHRD, VOIC, BREATH (or LEN)

| Knob | Setting | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **OCTAVES** (−2 to +2) | The chords' register from their home around C3. |
| 2 | **CHRD** | SCL > CHORD's chord kind: OFF plays triads; DIA3 and DIA7 triads and sevenths in the scale; MAJ, MIN, DOM7, MAJ7, MIN7, SUS4, POW. |
| 3 | **VOICING** | CLOSE, OPEN, INV1, INV2 or +OCT. |
| 4 | **BREATH** (0–100 %) | With HIT HOLD the chord breathes: each voice is struck again, softer, on a slow cycle of its own (11 to 19 s), and the same chord again is tied over. BREATH is the chance a voice above the lowest sits a cycle out; 0 (OFF) is off. |
| 4 | **LENGTH** (USER only, in BREATH's place) | How many of USER's chords play, 1 to 8. |

**USER progressions.** Set PROG to USER, hold OCT+ on GEN and play the roots on the keys, one key a chord (the keys
are silent while OCT+ is held; notes outside the scale round down to it). Letting OCT+ go ends the entry, and the
number of chords played sets LENGTH.

### QUAD: columns and RANGE

The grid's columns can turn between the rows, so notes travel from track to track. With OCT+ held:
KNOB 1 picks the column, KNOB 2 its **MOVE** (STOP, DOWN, UP or RAND), KNOB 3 its **EVERY** (/1 to /16 steps of
the first QUAD track), and KNOB 4 **RANGE** (3 OCT, 1 OCT, 2 OCT or ±1: the octaves the row's notes fold into).

### CONSTELLATION: LOCK, LEN, FILL, SIZE

| Knob | Setting | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **LOCK** | The chance a step plays the loop of stars already caught instead of the sky: high LOCK repeats a phrase. |
| 2 | **LEN** (1–16) | The loop's length. |
| 3 | **FILL** | OFF: the steps between stars rest. ARP: the last four stars again, low to high and softer. |
| 4 | **SIZE** (0–7) | How many rows either side of the crosshair a star still plays in. |

**AUTO** steers the ship for you: OFF follows Y, 1 to 9 is a wander of its own (faster further up), SEEK flies to
the next star. It has no knob: set it with a mod to **C AUTO** (a cord with no source is a fixed value).

### TURING and EUCLID: SOURCE, KEEP (STEP as seed)

**SOURCE** (KNOB 1) lets TURING or EUCLID play from a STEP pattern you wrote. T1 to T4 is that track's pattern
playing now, and it can be this track's own. The pattern itself never changes. OFF, or a pattern with no notes,
plays the generator as usual.

- **TURING** loops the source's first LEN steps (up to 16). Each step, PROB is the chance that the step about to
  play changes and stays changed, as a Turing machine flips a bit. PROB 0 plays your melody as written; turn it up
  and the melody drifts. A new SOURCE or LEN, or PLAY, starts again from the pattern.
- **EUCLID** plays the source's notes in order on its own hits, so the melody gets a new rhythm.

**KEEP** (KNOB 2) says what stays as written:

| KEEP | TURING | EUCLID |
|---|---|---|
| **FREE** | a step's pitch or its hit may change | the source's notes on EUCLID's hits |
| **RHYTHM** | only the pitches change (to another note of the loop) | the source's own rhythm, on EUCLID's pitches |
| **PITCH** | only the hits come and go | as FREE |

The notes keep their written pitch, then follow this track's scale, TRN and SHIFT. Print (REC held) keeps what it
played, as for any generator.

---

## EVOLVE

On a generator track, EVOLVE mutates the phrase every few bars.

| Knob | Setting | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **LOCK** (0–100 %) | How much of the phrase stays: 100 loops it, 0 is new every pass. Turing's LOCK is its PROB turned round, Atlas' its CHAOS turned round, Constellation's the chance of its loop. The other generators (Euclid, Bounce, Awake, Poly, Quad, Series, Chord, Answer) have none. |
| 2 | **EVERY** | Mutates every OFF, 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 bars. OFF keeps the phrase. |
| 3 | **AMOUNT** (0–100 %) | How much changes each time. |
| 4 | **ROLL** (1–128) | The track's seed. While playing, a new seed starts on the track's next bar line (the number blinks until then). |

With LOCK up, Turing's loop is its LENGTH long; Markov's and Morph's loops are as long as PATTERN's **LEN**.

### STEP EVOLVE

On a **STEP** track, EVOLVE varies the steps you wrote, as they play, without changing them.

| Knob | Setting | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **LOCK** (0–100 %) | How much of the variation stays from round to round: 100 holds it, 0 is fresh each time. |
| 2 | **EVERY** | Bars between rounds of changes; OFF plays the steps as written. |
| 3 | **AMOUNT** (0–100 %) | How many steps change, up to half: a note moved by a degree or two or an octave, a step dropped, two notes swapped, a ghost note in a rest. |
| 4 | **CLEAR** | Shows how many steps are changed now; turn it to go back to the steps as written. |

Hold **REC** to keep the changes playing: they become the steps (KEPT n STEPS). EDIT held undoes it. Switching
pattern clears the changes.

<p align="center"><img src="assets/gallery/gen_evolve.png" alt="EVOLVE" width="240"> <img src="assets/gallery/step_evolve.png" alt="STEP EVOLVE" width="240"></p>

## FORM

FORM strings mutated phrases into a short song form of sections A, B and C, each EVERY bars long.

| Knob | Setting | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **FORM** | OFF, AB, ABAC, ABCB, AABA, ABCA or AABC. Turning it on with EVERY OFF sets EVERY to 4 bars. |
| 2 | **CONTR** (0–100 %) | Contrast: how far a new section moves from the one before. |
| 3 | **CLEAR** | Forgets B and C: the phrase playing becomes A. |
| 4 | **FLRSH** (−12 to +12) | Flourish: semitones added on the last beat of every phrase; 0 is off. |

A section played again comes back exactly. B and C are made from the section before, by CONTR, the first time they
are reached. Changing MODE or ROLL starts the form again at A.

---

## TWEAK

| Knob | Setting | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **SHIFT** (±24) | Transposes by semitones; while following, by scale steps from the followed note. |
| 2 | **DROP** (0–100 %) | The chance a hit is left out, whatever the generator. |
| 3 | **HUMAN** (0–100 %) | Varies each note's velocity and length a little, as a player would: at 100 up to 20 softer or louder and up to half as long, the same each time the piece plays. The timing is TIMING's **HUMAN**. |
| 4 | **FOLLOW** | OFF, or T1 to T4: plays that track's pitch, SHIFT away, in this track's scale. STEP tracks can be followed too. The followed track is drawn in its own colour. |

On an ATLAS track only DROP and HUMAN apply: SHIFT, FOLLOW and FLRSH would change which drum plays. On a STEP track
TWEAK holds HUMAN alone.

---

## TWEAK 2

TWEAK 2 decides which hits play, and where. Everything starts OFF.

| Knob | Setting | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **BRANCH** (0–100 %) | The chance a hit plays on track TO's sound instead, so two tracks answer each other. The tosses replay with the seed. |
| 2 | **TO** | OFF, or a track and a mode: **COIN** tosses each hit, **TOGGLE** switches side on a toss won (100 % alternates), **LATCH** tosses once a bar. |
| 3 | **LOGIC** | OFF, AND, OR, XOR or NOT with another track's hits. A lower track's hit is read on this step, a higher one's on the step before. |
| 4 | **COND** | The bars a hit may play in, counted from PLAY (with FORM on, from the section's start): 1:2, 2:2, 1:4 to 4:4, 1:8, 8:8, FIRST or !FIRST. |

## LENGTH

How long a generator holds its notes.

| Knob | Setting | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **LENGTH** | **STEP**: the step's GATE. **FIXED**: LEN, whatever the DIV. **HIT**: until the next hit, so rests let notes ring. ATLAS keeps STEP. |
| 2 | **LEN** | FIXED's length: 1/32 to 1/1 (a bar). |
| 3 | **KEYS** (1–4) | FIXED: how many notes may hold at once. |
| 4 | **GATE** | The track's step gate, as on PATTERN. |

<p align="center"><img src="assets/gallery/gen_length.png" alt="LENGTH" width="240"></p>

---

## TIMING

Ratchets: a step's notes played again within the step. And HUMAN: each step a little late.

| Knob | Setting | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **RATCH** (x1–x8) | How many times a generator's step plays, in its own step: x1 once, as written, up to x8. |
| 2 | **CHANCE** (0–100 %) | How often a step ratchets: 100 every step, below that some play once. The tosses replay with the seed. |
| 3 | **SHAPE** | Where the hits fall: **EVEN** in equal parts, **ACCEL** closer and closer (a roll that speeds up), **DECEL** further and further apart (a bounce). |
| 4 | **HUMAN** (0–60 ms) | Plays each step a little late, as a player behind the beat: up to this many ms, a new amount each step, never early and never more than a quarter of the step. The same each time the piece plays. 0 keeps the grid. Also a cord destination (H TIME). |

On a STEP track TIMING holds SHAPE and HUMAN: each step has its own Ratchet (below). HUMAN adds to a step's Nudge;
an early Nudge stays as it is.

Projects saved before HUMAN had its own knob keep their feel: a generator track's TWEAK HUMAN becomes this HUMAN at a
fifth of it (TWEAK 100: 20 ms).

<p align="center"><img src="assets/gallery/gen_timing.png" alt="TIMING, x4 ACCEL" width="240"></p>

### A step's Ratchet and Nudge

On a STEP track's NOTES page, **OCT+** on a note opens its sheet (on the drum grid, OCT+ on a hit). Besides Length,
Velocity and Chance it holds:

- **Ratchet** (x1–x8): the step plays that many times in its own step, placed by TIMING's SHAPE.
- **Nudge** (−8/16 to +7/16): the step plays that many sixteenths of a step late or early. An early step plays near
  the end of the step before, and across the loop too, but not across a pattern change or a song's turn, nor while
  recording: there it plays on its line.

<p align="center"><img src="assets/gallery/sheet_note.png" alt="A note's sheet, Ratchet x3 and Nudge +2/16" width="240"></p>

## ENERGY

The project's slow shape over minutes, the same for every track (after Zen-1's conductor, the idea only). Both are
off at 0.

| Knob | Setting | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **ARC** (0–100 %) | A slow tide, 3 to 6 minutes a turn: from the tracks as set to sparse and back. At the sparse end the generator tracks leave out up to 70 % more of their hits and play softer. ARC is how far it swings. |
| 2 | **RESTS** (0–100 %) | How often the music rests: 8 to 18 s with the generator tracks silent (a CHORD track's held chord goes on), about every 4 minutes at 100, every 20 near 0, sooner while the tide is sparse. |
| 3 | **NOW** | Where the tide is while playing: +100 full, −100 sparse. |
| 4 | **REST** | The seconds left of a rest. |

PLAY starts the tide from the project's seeds, so a piece plays the same each time. ENERGY is also a cord source in
MODS: send it to a filter or a send and the sound follows the tide too.

<p align="center"><img src="assets/gallery/gen_energy.png" alt="ENERGY" width="240"></p>

## Print and keep

Hold **REC** on a generator track to **print**: what the generator played in its last bars goes into the track's
STEP pattern (1, 2 or 4 bars, as many as the notes span), and the track switches to STEP and plays on from the same
place. Hold EDIT to undo, which puts the generator back.

- Steps written by hand already there: **REPLACE STEPS?** OCT+ prints over them, OCT- keeps them.
- Recorded notes there: **CLEAR PATTERN TO PRINT**.
- On a STEP track playing STEP EVOLVE's changes, REC held keeps the changes instead.
- On a STEP track without them, REC held captures what you played on the keys in the last bars.

---

## Harmony: one key, CHORD and QNT CHRD

**One key for the project.** The scale (SCL), QNT and the MPC degree are always the same on every track. The key
note, ROOT, is too while **SCL > Key link** is **LINKED** (the default in a new project): change ROOT on any melodic
track, from SCL's list or with SCL held and a key, and every melodic track follows; drum tracks keep their own.
**OWN** gives each track its own ROOT again; turning LINKED back on gives every track the selected track's key. Key
link is saved with the project (a project saved before it loads as OWN). TRN still moves a single track.

A **CHORD** track plays a progression; with **QNT CHRD** the other tracks follow it.

- On the CHORD track: GEN, MODE **CHORD**, then **PROG**, **BARS** and **HIT**. The chord's kind and voicing come
  from **SCL > CHORD** (CHRD, VOIC), or the OCT+ layer. CHRD OFF plays triads.
- On any other track: **SCL**, **QNT** to **CHRD**. Its keys, its MIDI input and its generator snap to the nearest
  note of the chord playing now. With no CHORD track, CHRD acts as SNAP.
- **CH PROG** is a mod destination, so a slow source can change progressions.

---

## MODS: the modulation cords

Tap **LFO** for **MODS**: up to 16 cords, each from a source on any track to a destination on any track. Four show
at a time, each with an activity light and a moving mark.

| Knob | What it sets |
|---|---|
| 1 | **Source**: `--`, then per track (T1 to T4) LFO, ENV, VEL, KEY, RAND, MODW, AT, EXPR, S&H, SLEW, the generator's GATE, NOTE and CV, DRIFT, TIDE 1 to 3, and SWARM 1 to 8; and the project's ENERGY. |
| 2 | **Mod**: which of the 16 the other knobs edit. |
| 3 | **Destination**, on a track: the voice (PITCH, CUTOFF, SHAPE, GAIN), the mix (LEVEL, PAN, SPREAD, FX SEND), the envelope and LFO settings, the engine's E1 to E8, and the generators' settings (T PROB, T LEN, E PULSE, E ROT, M LEAP, M DENS, MP POS, SHIFT, DROP, HUMAN, BRANCH, EV AMT, CONTR, AT X, AT Y, AT DENS, AT KICK, AT SNR, AT HAT, AT TOMS, B SPEED, B ANGLE, A PROB, Q PROB, C Y, C SIZE, C DENS, C AUTO, S START, CH PROG, AN VARY, H TIME). |
| 4 | **Amount**, −100 to +100 %. With no source (`--`) the cord is a fixed move and KNOB 4 sets its offset. |

- **BI and UNI.** A bipolar source (LFO at POL BI, KEY, RAND, S&H, SLEW, NOTE, DRIFT, TIDE, SWARM, ENERGY) swings both
  ways from the knob. Press **OCT+** on MODS to make the picked mod **UNI**: the source folded to 0 to 1, so it moves
  one way only, as ENV does.
- Choosing a destination on a new cord sets the amount to 50 % (or a fixed move of 25 % with no source), so you hear
  it at once.
- **Live marks**: a knob a cord reaches shows a mark where the cords move it now.
- **DRIFT** is each track's slow wander, a new point about every 12 seconds, eased between.
- Melodee's MOD routes, in old projects and sounds, become cords when they load. If all 16 are in use the screen
  says **MODS FULL**.

<p align="center"><img src="assets/gallery/cords.png" alt="MODS" width="240"> <img src="assets/gallery/mods_live.png" alt="A live mod mark on BRANCH" width="240"></p>

---

## MATRIX

MATRIX, after MODS, shows the cords as a 4 x 4 grid: source track down the left (FROM), destination track along the
top (TO). A cell is lit, in the source track's colour, when a cord goes that way, as bright as the cords move it now.

| Knob | What it does |
|---|---|
| 1 | **FROM**: the row. |
| 2 | **TO**: the column. |
| 3 | **MOD**: which of the cell's cords, when it holds more than one. |
| 4 | **OPEN**: press **OCT+** to open that cord in MODS. |

<p align="center"><img src="assets/gallery/matrix.png" alt="MATRIX" width="240"></p>

---

## ORGANIC: TIDE and SWARM

Each track has its own TIDE and SWARM, slow sources inspired by Nonlinear Circuits' Triple Sloth and Instruō's ochd.

| Knob | Setting | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **SPEED** (0–100) | TIDE's speed. At 50 its three chaotic circuits take about 17 minutes (**TIDE 1**), 3 minutes (**TIDE 2**) and 1 minute (**TIDE 3**) a turn; each 12.5 more is twice as fast. |
| 2 | **RATE** (0–100) | SWARM's speed. At 50, **SWARM 1** takes 64 s a turn and **SWARM 8** 2.4 s; each 12.5 more is twice as fast. |

PLAY restarts them from the track's seed, so a piece replays the same way. Pick them as sources on MODS.

<p align="center"><img src="assets/gallery/organic.png" alt="ORGANIC" width="240"></p>

---

## Mod shortcut

Hold **FX** and turn a knob on any page: a cord from the track's shortcut source (its LFO, unless you turn SELECT
while FX is held to pick another) to that knob's parameter, on the same track. Turning sets the amount, like the
attenuverter beside a knob on a modular.

- The first turn makes the cord in a free MODS slot; back at 0 the slot is free again.
- If a cord already reaches that parameter on this track, that cord is edited, whatever its source.
- A parameter no cord can reach shows **no mod**.

<p align="center"><img src="assets/gallery/mod_shortcut.png" alt="Mod shortcut" width="240"></p>

---

## Help card

Hold **ARP** and turn any knob: a card with its parameter, its value and what it does, on every page (on a page's own
knobs, such as NOTES, SONG or PATTERNS, what that knob does there). The value does not change. Turn the **same knob**
further to scroll a long text, back to scroll up. Let go of ARP to close it.

<p align="center"><img src="assets/gallery/help.png" alt="Help card" width="240"></p>

---

## Menu and settings

Hold **HOME** for the menu. Tessera's additions:

| Item | What it does |
|---|---|
| **COLOR** | The palette: SMALTI (Tessera's own), MARMO, VITRO, NIGHT or CONTRAST. |
| **MIDI OUT** | What goes out over USB MIDI: **KEYS** (the notes you play, as Melodee sent them), **ALL** (also the steps, the ARP, recordings and every generator) or **OFF**. Each track on its own channel: see [MIDI OUT channels](#midi-out-channels). |
| **CLOCK OUT** | 24 pulses a beat with START and STOP over USB, while the clock is INT. |
| **PANEL GAMMA** | The screen's contrast curve: the panel chip's own **G2.2** (the default), G1.8, G2.5 and G1.0, or TUNED and TUNED+VCOM. The screen goes black for a moment and redraws. Saved. |
| **TRACK KNOB** | RIGHT: the ALGORITHM knob picks the track and PRESETS browses sounds, as printed. LEFT: the two swap. |
| **ABOUT** | Version, credits and, after a crash, LAST CRASH (until power-off). |

### MIDI OUT channels

**GLO > MIDI OUT** sets the channel each track's notes go out on, so every track can play its own instrument:
**KNOB 1** to **4** for tracks 1 to 4.

- **AUTO** (the default) works as before: the channel follows **SYSTEM > ROUT** (CH1-4: tracks on 1 to 4), and a
  drum track uses the **DRUM** channel.
- **1** to **16**: that channel, whatever ROUT and DRUM say.
- **OFF**: none of the track's notes go out.

The page lists each track's channel as it is now, AUTO's included. The channels are saved with the project. Which
notes go out at all is still the menu's **MIDI OUT** (KEYS, ALL or OFF): for the steps and the generators, set it to
**ALL**.

<p align="center"><img src="assets/gallery/midi_out.png" alt="GLO > MIDI OUT" width="240"></p>

## Saving and older projects

A project holds everything in one record: the patterns, the sounds, the generators with their seeds, sections and
layers, ENERGY, and the cords. Tessera 2.0 has a project format of its own: projects saved by Melodee (Tess) 1.x or
by Melodee show **OLD FORMAT** in their slot and do not load (there is no converter), and the first save writes over
them. Melodee's own preset banks are not carried over.

**A new project**: tap **SAVE** to the **PROJECT** page, turn **KNOB 1** down the list to **New song** and press
**OCT+** (playback stops; with unsaved changes, **OCT+** again answers Yes to "Start a new song?"). The NEW SONG
screen asks for the key (**KNOB 1** root, **2** scale, **3** tempo), then,
after **OCT+**, a role per track (**KNOB 1** to **4**): **KEEP** its sound, or **DRUMS**, **BASS**, **CHORDS**,
**LEAD** or **PAD** for the first sound of that kind. **OCT+** creates it with every pattern empty; **OCT-** goes back
or cancels. It starts from the template when one is saved in TMPL, else from the power-on sounds, and has no slot
until you save it.

The web editor's **Complete backup** saves and restores the music, slots A to D, the sound banks and the settings.
To try the [demo projects](demos/README.md), `tools/demo_backup.py` puts them into slots of your own backup.

## If something goes wrong

- **Single core.** If your FM-1 crashes with the standard build (red crash screen, freezes, or restarts into update
  mode), install the `-1core` firmware from the same release.
- **TESSERA CRASH.** If the crash screen shows, take a photo; after a restart, MENU > ABOUT shows LAST CRASH until
  power-off. Please add both to a bug report.
- **Update mode.** Hold **OCT-** alone while switching on to start the update loader, then reinstall from the web
  installer. See [docs/RECOVERY.md](docs/RECOVERY.md) for a unit stuck in UBOOT.
- Do not unplug the FM-1 while it is writing. This is experimental firmware: use it at your own risk.
