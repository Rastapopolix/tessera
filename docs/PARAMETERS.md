# Parameters

Every setting of Tessera with its number, generated from `firmware/src/pid.c` by `tests/pid_test.c` (`PID_UPDATE=1 sh tests/run_tests.sh` rewrites it; the suite fails when it is out of date). The numbers are fixed: mods and saved projects keep them.

The engine's eight (ENGINE 1 to 8) are named by the track's engine; their ranges here are the first track's default engine's.

| 0x21C | BOUNCE ANGLE | 0 to 90 | 37 | The ball's path from the floor, in degrees: 0 and 90 go back and forth, an angle between draws a longer loop. EVOLVE nudges it. In FALL it is the WIND: the middle is calm, lower blows the leaves left (the melody leans low), higher right (high); further out, gusts hurry them down together. |
| 0x21D | BOUNCE BALLS | 1 to 5 | 1 | How many balls: each one more starts from a place and an angle of its own, so they cross; balls hitting on the same step play together, three notes at most. Past 4, FALL: eight leaves fall at speeds of their own and play where they land (left low, right high; one in seven an octave down), rest, and fall again. |
| 0x21E | AWAKE LENGTH A | 1 to 16 | 8 | Steps in loop A, the melody: its values are degrees of the scale or rests. ROLL draws them, EVOLVE changes a few; a white key picks a step: KNOB 1 its A, KNOB 2 its B. |
| 0x21F | AWAKE LENGTH B | 1 to 16 | 7 | Steps in loop B, which lifts the melody up the scale; a length other than A's shifts it against A. |
| 0x220 | AWAKE PROB | 0 to 100 % | 100 | The chance each of A's notes plays: 100 every one, lower leaves gaps. |
| 0x221 | POLY RHYTHM 1 | OFF, /1, /2, /3, /4, /5, /6, /7, /8, /9, /10, /11, /12, /13, /14, /15, /16 | /4 | Every how many steps rhythm 1 moves the four notes on (OFF: never). Rhythms that land together play once, louder: 4 against 3 is a polyrhythm. |
| 0x222 | POLY RHYTHM 2 | OFF, /1, /2, /3, /4, /5, /6, /7, /8, /9, /10, /11, /12, /13, /14, /15, /16 | /3 | Every how many steps rhythm 2 moves the four notes on (OFF: never). |
| 0x223 | POLY RHYTHM 3 | OFF, /1, /2, /3, /4, /5, /6, /7, /8, /9, /10, /11, /12, /13, /14, /15, /16 | OFF | Every how many steps rhythm 3 moves the four notes on (OFF: never). |
| 0x224 | POLY RHYTHM 4 | OFF, /1, /2, /3, /4, /5, /6, /7, /8, /9, /10, /11, /12, /13, /14, /15, /16 | OFF | Every how many steps rhythm 4 moves the four notes on (OFF: never). |
| 0x225 | POLY SPAN | 1 to 3 | 1 | Octaves the four notes spread over; ROLL draws them, EVOLVE moves them a little. |
| 0x226 | TWEAK BRANCH | 0 to 100 % | 0 | The chance a hit plays on track TO's sound instead of this one's, so two tracks answer each other; 0 is off. The tosses replay with the SEED. |
| 0x227 | TWEAK BRANCH TO | OFF, T1, T2, T3, T4 | OFF | The track a branched hit plays on; OFF keeps every hit here. Turned on: COIN tosses each hit, TOGGLE switches side on a toss won, LATCH tosses once a bar. |
| 0x228 | TWEAK BRANCH MODE | COIN, TOGGLE, LATCH | COIN | COIN tosses each hit; TOGGLE switches side on a toss won (100 alternates); LATCH tosses once a bar and keeps the bar's hits on one side. |
| 0x229 | TWEAK LOGIC | OFF, AND, OR, XOR, NOT | OFF | Combines the hits with track WITH's: AND plays only when both hit, OR when either does, XOR when one does, NOT only when the other rests; OFF is its own. |
| 0x22A | TWEAK LOGIC WITH | OFF, T1, T2, T3, T4 | OFF | The track LOGIC reads: a lower track's hit on this step, a higher one's on the step before. |
| 0x22B | TWEAK COND | OFF, 1:2, 2:2, 1:4, 2:4, 3:4, 4:4, 1:8, 8:8, FIRST, !FIRST | OFF | The bars a hit may play in, counted from PLAY (with FORM on, from the section's start): 1:4 is the first bar of every four; FIRST only the first, !FIRST the rest. |
| 0x22C | TIDE SPEED | 0 to 100 | 50 | How fast the track's TIDE drifts (mods: TIDE 1, 2, 3, three slow chaotic circuits): 50 is about 17, 3 and 1 minutes a turn; each 12.5 more twice as fast. |
| 0x22D | SWARM RATE | 0 to 100 | 50 | How fast the track's eight SWARM LFOs run: 50 is 64 s for SWARM 1 down to 2.4 s for SWARM 8; each 12.5 more twice as fast. |
| 0x22E | QUAD DIRECTION | FWD, BACK, PEND, RAND, HOLD | FWD | How the track's playhead moves along its row of the grid: forward, back, back and forth, at random; HOLD rests on its own steps and moves only when a LINK moves it. |
| 0x22F | QUAD PROB | 0 to 100 % | 100 | The chance each of the row's notes plays: 100 every one, lower leaves gaps. |
| 0x230 | QUAD LINK | OFF, T1, T2, T12, T3, T13, T23, T123, T4, T14, T24, T124, T34, T134, T234, T1234 | OFF | Other QUAD tracks this one's steps also move on, one, two or all three, each played for this step's gate: slow tracks pulled along by a fast one, or HOLD tracks played only by this one. |
| 0x231 | NOTE LENGTH | STEP, FIXED, HIT | STEP | How long the generator holds its notes. STEP: the step's GATE. FIXED: LEN, whatever DIV. HIT: until the next hit, so rests let notes ring on. Atlas keeps STEP. |
| 0x232 | NOTE LENGTH LEN | 1/32, 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1/1 | 1/8 | FIXED's length, from a 32nd note to a bar (1/1), at the tempo the note starts. |
| 0x233 | NOTE LENGTH KEYS | 1 to 4 | 4 | FIXED: how many notes may hold at once. One more ends the note nearest its end; the same pitch again ends the one before. |
| 0x234 | CONSTELLATION Y | 0 to 14 | 7 | The height of the ship's crosshair in the sky: the stars crossing it play as they cross, so it sets where the melody sits. AUTO steers it instead. |
| 0x235 | CONSTELLATION DENS | 0 to 100 % | 50 | How many stars the sky holds: more stars, more notes. |
| 0x236 | CONSTELLATION SIZE | 0 to 7 | 2 | How many rows either side of the crosshair a star still plays in: 0 only its own row, higher a wider melody. OCT+ held on GEN, KNOB 4. |
| 0x237 | CONSTELLATION AUTO | OFF, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, SEEK | OFF | Who steers the ship: OFF your Y; 1 to 9 a wander of its own, faster further up; SEEK flies towards the next star. Set by a mod (no knob of its own). |
| 0x238 | SERIES START | 0 to 127 | 0 | Where in the infinity series the melody begins: each START a different line, all of them alike at every scale. EVOLVE picks new ones. |
| 0x239 | SERIES INTV | 1 to 7 | 1 | How many degrees of the scale a step of the series is: 1 close and stepwise, higher wider leaps (folded back into two octaves). |
| 0x23A | SERIES LOOP | OFF, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 | OFF | OFF lets the series run on, never repeating; 1 to 16 plays that many steps of it round and round. |
| 0x23E | QUAD RANGE | 3 OCT, 1 OCT, 2 OCT, +-1 | 3 OCT | The octaves the row's notes fold into: 3 OCT as they are, 1 OCT or 2 OCT from the root up, +-1 an octave either side of it. OCT+ held on GEN, KNOB 4. |
| 0x23F | QUAD MOVE 1 | STOP, DOWN, UP, RAND | STOP | How a column of QUAD's grid moves its cells between the four rows: STOP, DOWN (each note a track down, track 4's to track 1), UP, or RAND (a jump of 1 to 3 rows). Rows not in QUAD turn too, keeping the notes. OCT+ held on GEN: KNOB 1 the column, KNOB 2 its MOVE. |
| 0x240 | QUAD MOVE 2 | STOP, DOWN, UP, RAND | STOP | How a column of QUAD's grid moves its cells between the four rows: STOP, DOWN (each note a track down, track 4's to track 1), UP, or RAND (a jump of 1 to 3 rows). Rows not in QUAD turn too, keeping the notes. OCT+ held on GEN: KNOB 1 the column, KNOB 2 its MOVE. |
| 0x241 | QUAD MOVE 3 | STOP, DOWN, UP, RAND | STOP | How a column of QUAD's grid moves its cells between the four rows: STOP, DOWN (each note a track down, track 4's to track 1), UP, or RAND (a jump of 1 to 3 rows). Rows not in QUAD turn too, keeping the notes. OCT+ held on GEN: KNOB 1 the column, KNOB 2 its MOVE. |
| 0x242 | QUAD MOVE 4 | STOP, DOWN, UP, RAND | STOP | How a column of QUAD's grid moves its cells between the four rows: STOP, DOWN (each note a track down, track 4's to track 1), UP, or RAND (a jump of 1 to 3 rows). Rows not in QUAD turn too, keeping the notes. OCT+ held on GEN: KNOB 1 the column, KNOB 2 its MOVE. |
| 0x243 | QUAD EVERY 1 | /1, /2, /3, /4, /6, /8, /16 | /4 | How often a column moves: every 1 to 16 steps of the first QUAD track. OCT+ held on GEN: KNOB 1 the column, KNOB 3 its EVERY. |
| 0x244 | QUAD EVERY 2 | /1, /2, /3, /4, /6, /8, /16 | /4 | How often a column moves: every 1 to 16 steps of the first QUAD track. OCT+ held on GEN: KNOB 1 the column, KNOB 3 its EVERY. |
| 0x245 | QUAD EVERY 3 | /1, /2, /3, /4, /6, /8, /16 | /4 | How often a column moves: every 1 to 16 steps of the first QUAD track. OCT+ held on GEN: KNOB 1 the column, KNOB 3 its EVERY. |
| 0x246 | QUAD EVERY 4 | /1, /2, /3, /4, /6, /8, /16 | /4 | How often a column moves: every 1 to 16 steps of the first QUAD track. OCT+ held on GEN: KNOB 1 the column, KNOB 3 its EVERY. |
| 0x247 | CONSTELLATION LEN | 1 to 16 | 16 | How many steps the loop of stars is, 1 to 16: with LOCK up a short phrase repeats. OCT+ held on GEN, KNOB 2. |
| 0x248 | CONSTELLATION FILL | OFF, ARP | OFF | What the steps between stars play: OFF a rest, ARP the last four stars again, low to high and softer. OCT+ held on GEN, KNOB 3. |
| 0x249 | CHORD PROG | POP, 50S, 2-5-1, CIRCLE, TWO, DRONE, WALK, USER | POP | The progression, on the degrees of the track's scale: POP I V vi IV, 50S I vi IV V, 2-5-1 ii V I I, CIRCLE the scale's fifths down, TWO I IV, DRONE I alone; WALK four chords of the track's SEED (ROLL another, EVOLVE changes one); USER up to eight of your own: hold OCT+ on GEN and play their roots on the keys, one key a chord (rounded down to the scale; letting OCT+ go ends it). SCL CHORD's CHRD and VOIC shape the chords (CHRD OFF: triads); hold OCT+ on GEN for OCT, CHRD and VOIC. |
| 0x24A | CHORD BARS | 1/2, 1, 2, 4 | 1 | How long each chord lasts: half a bar, 1, 2 or 4 bars. |
| 0x24B | CHORD HIT | HOLD, BEAT, STEP, OFFBEAT | HOLD | How the chord plays: HOLD once, held to the next chord; BEAT struck again every beat; STEP every step, for the step's GATE; OFFBEAT a short stab on the off-beats, the "and" halfway between the beats (reggae's skank), for the step's GATE: at 1/8 an eighth at most, at 1/16 a sixteenth, and SWING moves it with the step (at 1/8 the "and" is the swung step). |
| 0x24C | CHORD OCT | -2 to 2 | 0 | The chords' register, -2 to +2 octaves from their home around C3. OCT+ held on GEN, KNOB 1; KNOB 2 and 3 there are SCL CHORD's CHRD and VOIC. |
| 0x24D | ATLAS KICK | 0 to 100 % | 100 | How much of DENSITY the kick gets: 100 all of it, 50 half, 0 none (the kick silent). OCT+ held on GEN, KNOB 1. |
| 0x24E | ATLAS SNARE | 0 to 100 % | 100 | How much of DENSITY the snare gets: 100 all of it, 0 none. OCT+ held on GEN, KNOB 2. |
| 0x24F | ATLAS HAT | 0 to 100 % | 100 | How much of DENSITY the closed hat gets: 100 all of it, 0 none. OCT+ held on GEN, KNOB 3. |
| 0x250 | ATLAS TOMS | 0 to 100 % | 0 | A fourth part, on the tom or the sound PART4 picks: the hits the kick and snare only just miss, so fills follow the groove. 0 none; up, misses further under the line play too (DENSITY scales it). OCT+ held on GEN, KNOB 4; with it held, a black key picks the sound. |
| 0x251 | CHORD USER LEN | 1 to 8 | 4 | How many of USER's chords play, 1 to 8: playing them in on the keys (OCT+ held on GEN) sets it; shorten it to leave the last ones out. OCT+ held on GEN, KNOB 4. |
| 0x252 | STEP EVOLVE LOCK | 0 to 100 % | 50 | A STEP track's EVOLVE page: how much of the variation stays from round to round. 100 holds it, 0 makes a fresh one each time. |
| 0x253 | STEP EVOLVE EVERY | OFF, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 | 1 | A STEP track's EVOLVE page: bars between rounds of changes; OFF plays the steps as written. |
| 0x254 | STEP EVOLVE AMOUNT | 0 to 100 % | 0 | A STEP track's EVOLVE page: how many steps play a change, 100 half of them: a note moved by a degree or two or an octave, a step dropped, two notes swapped, a ghost note in a rest. 0 plays the steps as written; the steps themselves never change until REC held keeps the changes. |
| 0x255 | ATLAS PART4 | TOM, CLAP, HATOP, RIM, BELL | TOM | The fourth part's sound: TOM, CLAP, HATOP (the open hat), RIM or BELL, the DRUM lanes besides the kick, snare and closed hat. Hold OCT+ on GEN and press its black key (as on the drum grid: CP OH TM RS CB). |
| 0x256 | TIMING RATCH | x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8 | x1 | Plays each step's notes 1 to 8 times in equal parts of the step, a ratchet; x1 plays them once, as written. Each hit gets its share of the step's GATE. Notes NOTE LENGTH holds (FIXED, HIT) and BRANCHed ones play once. |
| 0x257 | TIMING CHANCE | 0 to 100 % | 100 | How often a step ratchets: 100 every step, 0 none. The toss replays with the track's SEED. |
| 0x258 | CHORD BREATH | 0 to 100 % | 0 | With HIT HOLD, the chord breathes: each voice is struck again, softer, on a slow cycle of its own (11 to 19 s), and the same chord again is tied over instead of struck (DRONE: one long chord). BREATH is the chance a voice above the lowest sits a cycle out, one at a time; 0 is off. OCT+ held on GEN, KNOB 4 (USER: its LEN there). |
| 0x259 | ENERGY ARC | 0 to 100 % | 0 | The project's slow tide, the same for every track: over 3 to 6 minutes it swings from the tracks as set to sparse and back. At the sparse end the generator tracks leave out up to 70 % more of their hits and play up to 16 softer, at the full end they take back their DROP and play up to 12 louder; ARC is how far it swings, round LEVEL, 0 off. It is the cord source ENERGY too (to a filter, a send). |
| 0x25A | ENERGY RESTS | 0 to 100 % | 0 | How often the music rests: 8 to 18 s with the generator tracks silent (a CHORD track's held chord and its BREATH go on), at 100 about every 4 minutes, near 0 about every 20, sooner while ARC's tide is sparse. 0 off. |
| 0x25B | ANSWER VARY | 0 to 100 % | 30 | How much each answer changes the phrase you played: a note moved a degree or two, an octave, left out or swapped with the next. Each answer changes it a little more. 0 answers it as played. |
| 0x25C | ANSWER ECHO | 0 to 100 % | 20 | The chance a note it plays comes back once more, at half its velocity, 3 to 8 steps later, one in four an octave up. 0 off. |
| 0x25D | ANSWER FADE | 0 to 100 % | 33 | How long it remembers: 1 answer at 0 to 16 at 99, each softer than the last, then it rests until you play again. Past 16 it never forgets: the notes play on as four loops of different lengths, SHORT, MID or LONG (LEN), so it never quite repeats. |
| 0x25E | ANSWER ORDER | PLAYED, REVERSE, SHUFFLE | PLAYED | The order of the notes in an answer, over the rhythm you played: PLAYED, REVERSE or SHUFFLE (a new order each answer). OCT+ held on GEN, KNOB 2. |
| 0x25F | ANSWER SHIFT | 0 to 7 | 2 | Each answer is moved up or down by up to this many degrees of the scale, a new amount each time. 0 keeps it where you played it. OCT+ held on GEN, KNOB 3. |
| 0x260 | ANSWER SPACE | 0 to 100 % | 25 | The rest before each answer: 0 answers straight away, 100 waits 4 bars. A bar without a key ends the phrase you play. OCT+ held on GEN, KNOB 4. |
| 0x261 | ANSWER LEN | SHORT, MID, LONG | MID | With FADE at 100, the lengths of the four loops the notes play on, in steps: SHORT 5 7 11 13, MID 13 17 23 29, LONG 23 29 31 37. FADE turned past 16. |
| 0x262 | TIMING SHAPE | EVEN, ACCEL, DECEL | EVEN | Where a ratchet's hits fall in their step: EVEN in equal parts, ACCEL closer and closer (a roll that speeds up), DECEL further and further apart (a bounce). The track's, for its RATCH and for every step's Ratchet on a STEP track. |
| 0x263 | MIDI OUT CHANNEL | AUTO, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, OFF | AUTO | The MIDI channel this track's notes go out on over USB, so each track can play its own instrument. AUTO follows SYSTEM's ROUT (CH1-4: tracks on 1 to 4), a drum track the DRUM channel; OFF sends none of its notes. Saved with the project. Which notes go out at all is the menu's MIDI OUT: KEYS, ALL or OFF. GLO > MIDI OUT, a knob for each track. |
| 0x264 | KEY LINK | OWN, LINKED | LINKED | LINKED: one key for the whole project. Changing ROOT on any melodic track sets it on the others too, as the scale always is; drum tracks keep theirs. OWN: each track its own ROOT. Turning it on gives every track the selected track's key. SCL's Key link row; on in a new project, saved with it. |
| 0x265 | SOURCE | OFF, T1, T2, T3, T4 | OFF | A STEP pattern for TURING, EUCLID, MARKOV or MORPH to play from: T1 to T4 is that track's pattern playing now (this track's own too), which stays as written. TURING loops its first LEN steps and PROB changes them a step at a time; EUCLID plays its notes in order on its hits; MARKOV learns what follows what in it (LEAP: jumps anywhere); MORPH blends it (A) with a variation of it (B). OFF, or a pattern without notes: the generator's own. ANSWER: the pattern's first 8 notes are its call, read again before each answer; the keys then just play. OCT+ held on GEN, KNOB 1. |
| 0x266 | KEEP | FREE, RHYTHM, PITCH | FREE | With a SOURCE, what stays as written. FREE: a step's pitch or its hit may change. RHYTHM: only the pitches change (EUCLID: the source's own rhythm, on EUCLID's pitches). PITCH: only the hits come and go (MARKOV: the notes in written order). OCT+ held on GEN, KNOB 2. |
| 0x267 | TIMING HUMAN | 0 to 60 ms | 0 | Plays each step a little late, as a player behind the beat: up to this many ms, a new amount each step, never early and never more than a quarter of the step. The same each time the piece plays. 0 on the grid. STEP tracks too (with a step's NUDGE). TWEAK's HUMAN varies velocity and length. |
| 0x268 | ACCUM LIMIT | 1 to 14 | 7 | How far a step's Accumulate takes its notes, in scale degrees from the note as written: 7 is an octave of a 7-note scale. The pattern's sheet (OCT+ held on NOTES). |
| 0x269 | ACCUM MODE | WRAP, PING, CLAMP | WRAP | What a step's Accumulate does at LIMIT. WRAP: back to the note as written, and on again. PING: turns round and comes back. CLAMP: stays there. PLAY and a new pattern start it again. |
| 0x26A | GRAVITY | 0 to 100 % | 0 | The pull home. With EVERY on, this share of EVOLVE's rounds moves the generator back toward its settings as you last set them, instead of changing it: it drifts, then comes home. With a SOURCE, this share of the steps plays the source as written at its place. 0: none. OCT+ held on EVOLVE, KNOB 1, or on GEN, KNOB 3. |
| 0x26B | EVOLVE HOW | DRIFT, ADORN, SERIAL | DRIFT | What STEP EVOLVE's rounds do to the steps. DRIFT: moves by scale degrees, octave jumps, drops, swaps and ghost notes. ADORN, ornaments that only add: ratchets, octave jumps, neighbour notes, passing notes in the rests. SERIAL: the whole phrase at once: backwards, upside down, rotated or half of it at half speed; AMOUNT is the chance of one a round, LOCK of it staying. OCT+ held on EVOLVE, KNOB 1. |
| 0x26C | ENERGY LEVEL | -100 to 100 | 0 | The project's energy, played by hand: ARC's tide swings round it. Up, the generator tracks take back their DROP and play up to 12 louder; down, they leave out hits and play softer. EVOLVE changes less when low, more when high. 0: as set. |
| 0x26D | ENERGY DEPTH | 0 to 100 % | 100 | How much ENERGY (its LEVEL, ARC's tide, RESTS) moves this track. 100 all of it, 0 an anchor that plays as set whatever the energy. OCT+ held on ENERGY, KNOB 1. |
| 0x26E | FORM DEVELOP | 0 to 100 % | 0 | How far a section varies each time FORM comes back to it: it stays recognisable but is never quite the same. The section itself is kept, so the next return starts from it again. GRAVITY is the chance a return stays exact. 0: every return exact. OCT+ held on FORM, KNOB 1. |
| 0x26F | MIDI OUT TRANSPOSE | -48 to 48 st | 0 | Moves this track's notes up or down on their way out over MIDI, in semitones (12 an octave), for an instrument or a MIDI-to-CV module that plays them too high or too low. The track's own sound is unchanged; a note moved past MIDI's range is not sent. 0: as played. Saved with the project. OCT+ held on GLO > MIDI OUT, a knob for each track. |
| 0x270 | TUNING | OFF, USR1, USR2, USR3, USR4 | OFF | A tuning of your own for the whole project, as the scale is: USR1 to USR4 play the Scala (.scl) files sent from the web editor (PROJECTS, Tunings), saved with the project. The keys, the generators, QNT and chords play its degrees; ROOT and TRN move it. OFF, or an empty slot, plays SCL's scale. SCL > SCALES, the USER family. |

## Mods

A mod (the MODS page, under LFO) moves a destination on any track by a source on any track: by its AMOUNT (-100 to 100 %, at a full source the destination's whole range; PITCH: an octave) plus its OFFSET. A mod's direction is shown under KNOB 1 and in its bar: +- moves both ways from the knob (the bar as far down as up), + one way only. A bipolar source (LFO, KEY, RAND, S&H, SLEW, NOTE, DRIFT, TIDE, SWARM, ENERGY) is +-; OCT+ on MODS makes it +, the source folded to 0 to 1, as ENV moves. The LFO page's POL (BI, UNI) is not the mod's: it shapes only that page's own depths (LFO PIT, FLT, SHP, AMP), and a mod from the LFO is +- or + by its own setting, whatever POL is. ENV, VEL, KEY and RAND on a voice destination (PITCH, CUTOFF, SHAPE, GAIN) of their own track follow each note, as a chord's; elsewhere the latest note. Room for 32, 16 in use. They are the project's, saved with it. Melodee's MOD page is gone: the four routes a project or a sound was saved with become mods on their track, the same move (a sound's go when another sound is loaded on the track, unless one was edited).
