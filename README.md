**Tessera** is a generative firmware for the M-Vave FM-1. Each of the four tracks can play its own steps, an
arpeggio, or one of thirteen generators, and the pages around them evolve the phrases, build song forms, pass hits
between tracks and modulate anything from anything. GPL-3.0-only. **Status: Experimental.**
By **Theo Dainis** ([Rastapopolix](https://github.com/Rastapopolix)).

Tessera grew out of Melodee (Tess), a fork of [Melodee](https://github.com/keremimo/melodee) by **keremimo**,
itself built on *Felucca* by **Leo Kuroshita / Hügelton Instruments**. Releases up to 1.3.x were published as
Melodee (Tess).

*Tessera* (plural *tesserae*) is the Latin word for the small tile of stone or glass in a mosaic. Each generator
makes a short phrase; EVOLVE and FORM set mutated phrases side by side into sections, so a piece is built from small
tiles arranged into a larger pattern. The word also meant a die, which suits the chance-driven generators.

## Install

Flash it from your browser (Chrome or Edge, FM-1 connected directly by USB):
**[Web installer](https://wiggismodular.github.io/tessera-moar/webapp/installer/)**. Afterwards you can edit sounds
and sequences from the computer with the [web editor](https://wiggismodular.github.io/tessera-moar/webapp/editor/).

Each release has two builds: `tessera-X.Y.fwsc` (standard, dual core: start here) and
`tessera-X.Y-1core.fwsc` (single core, for FM-1s that crash with the standard build).

Do not unplug the FM-1 while it is writing. This is experimental firmware: use it at your own risk. The installer
page also has a way back to the official V15 firmware, with a backup first.

## What's inside

* **Thirteen generators** on SEQ > GEN: TURING, EUCLID, MARKOV, MORPH, ATLAS (with a fourth drum part), BOUNCE (and
  FALL), AWAKE, POLY, QUAD, CONSTELLATION, SERIES, CHORD and ANSWER, besides the step sequencer and the arpeggiator.
* **Shaping**: EVOLVE mutates a phrase every few bars, and **STEP EVOLVE** does the same to steps you wrote; FORM
  builds sections such as AABA; TWEAK shifts, drops, humanises or follows another track; TWEAK 2 branches hits
  to another track's sound, combines tracks with logic, and plays only on certain bars; LENGTH sets how long notes
  hold.
* **Harmony**: one key and scale for the whole project (**Key link**); a CHORD track plays a progression (or your
  own), and **QNT CHRD** makes the other tracks follow it.
* **Modulation**: 16 cords from any source to any destination on any track, generators included; slow organic
  sources (TIDE, SWARM); live marks on every knob a cord moves, and **MATRIX** to see the whole patch.
* **Print**: hold REC to turn what a generator played into ordinary steps.
* **Sounds**: FM6 (six-operator FM, three engine models), TRIO, ANALOG, PHASE, LOFI, GURDY and DRUM (808, 909, SID KIT).
* **MIDI OUT** of every track and the generators, each on a channel of its own (GLO > MIDI OUT), and **CLOCK OUT**,
  over USB.
* **Its own look**: the SMALTI palette, square tiles, Chakra Petch, and an animated mosaic splash.

The **[manual](MANUAL.md)** covers every page, knob and shortcut; **[RECIPES.md](RECIPES.md)** has step-by-step
patches and tips.

## Building

See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md). The host tests run with `tests/run_tests.sh`; the gallery renders with
`tests/gallery_render.c` (build line at its top) and the banner and social preview with `tools/gen_brand.py`.

## About me

I'm Theo Dainis, from New Zealand. I've been using and building synthesisers for the past 15 years, and I'm passionate about modular and open source. Elektron and Mutable Instruments are big influences on me. I love the DIY side: building things, and learning how music hardware works on the inside. Tessera is the sequencer I wanted on the FM-1: modular in a box, a small instrument that writes with you.

### Built with Claude Code

Tessera's code is written with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), Anthropic's AI coding tool. I designed it, made the decisions, and test every release on my own FM-1 before it goes out. The source is open, so you can read every line and every change. Like any firmware, it comes with no warranty: save a **Complete backup** from the web editor before you flash.
