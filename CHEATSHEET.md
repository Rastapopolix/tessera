# Tessera shortcuts

The buttons and combinations of Tessera on one sheet, a supplement to the **[manual](MANUAL.md)**. A printable
two-page version is [docs/cheatsheet/tessera-cheatsheet.pdf](docs/cheatsheet/tessera-cheatsheet.pdf).

**A + B**: hold A, then press or turn B. **Held**: about 0.7 s (the GLO and SCL layers: MENU > HOLD, 0.3 to 0.6 s);
ARP, FX, LFO and OCT+ on GEN work as soon as they are down. Page buttons act when let go. KNOB 1 to 4 are the four knobs from the left.

## Getting around

| Do this | And this happens |
|---|---|
| **HOME** | The home page: four tracks, their sounds and knobs |
| **HOME** held | The menu (held again: leaves it) |
| **ALGORITHM** | Picks the track, on every page (MENU > TRACK KNOB LEFT swaps it with PRESETS) |
| **SELECT** | The pages of the section shown, both ways |
| A page button again | That section's next page (from elsewhere most return to the page last used) |
| **OCT-** (off HOME) | Back: closes a list, sheet or map, else HOME |
| **OCT+** (off HOME) | Enter: opens the row, slot or note picked; does the action picked |
| **OCT+** held | The page's sheet: the sound's (HOME, EDIT, ENV, LFO, FX), the pattern's (GEN, NOTES, PATTERN; Swing there), the song's (SONG), the pattern's on PATTERNS |
| A sheet: **KNOB 1**, **OCT+** / **OCT-** | Picks the row / does it / closes |
| A dialog: **OCT+** / **OCT-** | Yes / no |
| Lists (menu, SCL, VOICE): **KNOB 1** / **KNOB 2** | The row / its value |

## The page buttons

| Tap (again: the next page) | Pages |
|---|---|
| **SEQ** | GEN, then the MODE's pages. STEP: EVOLVE, TWEAK, TIMING, NOTES. ARP: ARP, ARP 2, NOTES. A generator: EVOLVE, FORM, TWEAK, TWEAK 2, LENGTH, TIMING, ENERGY. All: PATTERN, TEMPO, PATTERNS, SONG |
| **SEQ** held | PATTERNS |
| **ARP** | STEP track: switches it to ARP, the ARP page (again: ARP 2). Generator track: GEN ("MODE IS ON GEN") |
| **LFO** | MODS, MATRIX, LFO, LFO 2, ORGANIC, LFO DEST; on FM6 then FM LFO; on ORACLE then LFO MOD, LFO ROUTE |
| **ENV** | ENV, ENV DEST; on FM6 instead EG RATE, EG LVL, PITCH EG, PITCH LV; on ORACLE FILT ENV, AMP ENV |
| **SCL** | SCALES, SCL, CHORD |
| **EDIT** | The sound's EDIT pages (ORACLE: MACRO, MACRO 2, OSC A, OSC B, OSC MIX, FILTER, POLY MOD, CHARACTER, ...) |
| **EDIT** on an EDIT page | The map of the sound's pages: KNOB 1 across, KNOB 2 rows, OCT+ opens, OCT- or EDIT closes |
| **PRESETS** on an EDIT page | The next / previous section (FM6: Algo, OP1 to OP6, Pitch, LFO, Ctrl, Store) |
| **FX** | The insert and send effects |
| **GLO** | MIXER, GLOBAL (BUDGET: the shared voices), SYSTEM, MIDI OUT |
| On **MIXER**: **KNOB 1** to **4** / with **OCT+** held | Level / pan of track 1 to 4; the keys mute and solo as with GLO held |
| **SAVE** | USER (save the sound), PROJECT, PRESETS |

## Quick layers: hold GLO or SCL

| Do this | And this happens |
|---|---|
| **GLO** held | [GLO] SET over the page |
| **GLO** + black keys F#3 G#3 A#3 C#4 | Mute / unmute track 1 to 4 (lit: sounding) |
| **GLO** + white keys F3 G3 A3 B3 | Solo track 1 to 4 while the key is held |
| **GLO** + C4 / F4 | Unmute all / tap the tempo (three taps or more; INT clock) |
| **GLO** + E4 | FILL, while held (steps set to FILL / !FILL) |
| **GLO** + KNOB 1 to 4 | Level of track 1 to 4 |
| **GLO** + PRESETS | Browse the selected track's sounds, on any page (the name shows at the top) |
| **GLO** + PLAY | Restart from the top without stopping |
| **SCL** + any key | ROOT: that key's note name (every melodic track while SCL > Key link is LINKED) |
| **SCL** + KNOB 1 to 4 | ROOT, SCALE, CHRD, VOIC |
| **GLO** / **SCL** + OCT- | Puts back what the layer changed since it opened |
| **GLO** or **SCL** tapped twice | Locks the layer open; press it again to close |

## Knob holds

| Do this | And this happens |
|---|---|
| **ARP** + a knob | The help card for that knob; turn on: scroll |
| **FX** + a knob | Mod shortcut: a cord from the track's LFO to that parameter, the turn sets its amount |
| **FX** + SELECT | The mod shortcut's source |
| **LFO** + a knob | A momentary change: back as it was when LFO is let go |
| **LFO** + a knob, then **OCT+** | Keeps the change ("KEPT") |
| **OCT-** / **OCT+** on HOME | Octave down / up; both together: octave 0 |

## Steps and notes (SEQ > NOTES)

| Do this | And this happens |
|---|---|
| Keys | The cursor step (pressed together: a chord of up to 4); let go: the cursor moves on |
| A key + SELECT | That note's length |
| **ENV** + SELECT or KNOB 1 | The cursor's note longer / shorter |
| **SCL** + SELECT or KNOB 1 | Moves the note (ties, chord and velocity with it) |
| **EDIT** tapped | Deletes the note and its ties |
| **OCT+** | The note's sheet (length, velocity, chance, ratchet x1–x8, nudge ±/16, accumulate ±7, condition 1:2..8:8, FILL...) |
| **OCT+** + SELECT, KNOB 1 or 2 | Selects a run of notes; let go: the Selected notes sheet (move, copy, quantize, delete) |
| **OCT-** | Clears the selection |
| **PRESETS** | Zooms the notes |
| **OCT+** held | The pattern's sheet: Double, Half, Euclid (hits, turn), Accum limit / mode, Quantize, Clear |

## The drum grid (NOTES on a DRUM track)

| Do this | And this happens |
|---|---|
| White keys | The selected lane's hit on that step, on or off |
| Black keys F#3 to A#4 | Pick lane 1 to 8 |
| C#5 + white key | The hit's accent |
| D#5 / F#5 | Page down / up (patterns over 16 steps) |
| KNOB 1 to 4 | STEP, LANE, HIT, ACC |
| **EDIT** | Clears the cursor step |
| **OCT+** | The hit's sheet (accent, chance, ratchet, nudge, condition) |

## Patterns

| Do this | And this happens |
|---|---|
| **SEQ** + white keys F3 to F4 | Pattern 1 to 8 (playing: from the next bar) |
| **SEQ** + a pattern key held + another | Copies the first pattern onto the second |
| **SEQ** + SELECT | The next / previous pattern |
| PATTERNS: KNOB 1 to 4 | Track 1 to 4's next pattern |
| PATTERNS: **OCT-** | Clears the queue (again: HOME) |

## Recording and transport

| Do this | And this happens |
|---|---|
| **PLAY** | Start / stop; on SONG: plays the song. Generators start from the top of their seed |
| **REC** | Arms the track; records every pass (overdub) until REC again (playing: from the loop's start) |
| **REC** + PLAY | Records now |
| **REC** held | Generator track: prints its last bars into STEP. STEP EVOLVE: keeps the changes. STEP: captures what you played |
| **REC** held on SONG | Take jam: the patterns played since PLAY become the song |
| **EDIT** held, recording on NOTES | Erases as the steps pass |
| **EDIT** + **REC** on NOTES | Clear pattern? (OCT+), REC stays on for a new take |
| **OCT-** / **OCT+** on NOTES, REC on | Keys octave down / up; both: octave 0 |
| **EDIT** held | Undo (the last load, capture or print; on NOTES the last edit) |
| **EDIT** + OCT- / OCT+ | Undo / redo |

## Saving and projects

| Do this | And this happens |
|---|---|
| **SAVE** + REC | Saves the project to its slot (stops playback first) |
| **SAVE** | USER, its Save sheet ready: OCT+ saves the sound |
| **EDIT** on USER or PROJECT | Renames the slot |
| **OCT+** on a PROJECT slot | Load, Save here, Rename, Boot, Erase |

## Generators

| Do this | And this happens |
|---|---|
| GEN: **KNOB 1** | MODE: STEP, ARP or a generator |
| GEN: **OCT+** held | The second layer: TURING, EUCLID, MARKOV, MORPH (SOURCE, KEEP, GRAVITY), QUAD, CHORD, ATLAS, CONSTL, ANSWER (SOURCE, ORDER, SHIFT, SPACE) |
| EVOLVE: **OCT+** held | GRAVITY (a generator); HOW: DRIFT, ADORN, SERIAL (a STEP track) |
| ATLAS: **OCT+** + a black key | The fourth part's sound (TOM, CLAP, OPEN HAT, RIM, BELL) |
| CHORD, PROG USER: **OCT+** + keys | One chord a key, its root the key's note |
| AWAKE: a white key | Picks that step: KNOB 1 its A, KNOB 2 its B; the key again lets it go |
| EVOLVE: **KNOB 4** (ROLL) | A new seed a click; turn back for the last one |
| FORM: **KNOB 3** (CLEAR) | Forgets B and C |
| FORM: **OCT+** held, **KNOB 1** | DEVELOP: each return of a section varies a little (0: exact) |
| MODS: **OCT+** | The picked mod: BI / UNI |
| MATRIX: **OCT+** | Opens the picked mod in MODS |

## Power-on and update

| Do this | And this happens |
|---|---|
| Any button or key at power-on | Skips the boot mark |
| **OCT-** alone while switching on | The update loader (three key-light flashes), to reinstall from the web installer |
| **OCT-** + **OCT+** while switching on | HARDWARE CALIBRATION: teach each button and knob |
| **OCT-** + **OCT+** held 5 s | Update mode (UBOOT); a countdown from 2 s, let go to cancel |
